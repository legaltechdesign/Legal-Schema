Schema.org markup for legal organizations

This repository has examples and resources for how legal services organizations can put Schema.org markup on their websites, to improve their search engine placement.

Schema.org markup can improve how legal service organizations can reach their target audience. Specifically, it can improve how search engines (like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.) show public interest websites and specific resources to their intended audience.

Schema.org markup is code to put on a website’s backend, that tells search engines important information about who they should show a website to. The Schema.org community is a non-profit group (founded originally by leading search engine companies). It defines the various terms and structures that organizations can use to mark up their websites. The markup represents information about

Organizational Details: Who your organization is, and what makes you authoritative on certain topics
Issue Areas: What kinds of problems and questions you can help people with
Jurisdictions: What jurisdictions and geographic areas you serve
Demographic Groups: What specific demographics of people you serve
Services: What specific hotlines, intake channels, clinics, and other events you offer\

See the definitions of the terms here: http://betterinternet.law.stanford.edu/markup-your-site/

You can use the standard Schema.org markup code to represent this information in ways that the search engines can understand automatically. This should improve how often your website is shown to people asking about legal issues, in your target jurisdictions and demographics.

Schema.org markup can complement other search engine optimization (SEO) strategies a group might already be using. To implement markup, follow the standards — and use the markup-creation tool that our Lab is building with support of a Legal Services Corporation Tech Innovation Grant, in collaboration with many legal aid and technologist stakeholders.
